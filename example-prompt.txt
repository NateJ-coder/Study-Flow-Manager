I want to change the mouse cursor color in my StudyFlow application. Currently, I think there might be some cursor enhancement features, but I want to make the cursor more visible and colorful. 

Specifically, I want to:
1. Change the cursor to a bright green color (#00FF00) when hovering over interactive elements
2. Add a subtle glow effect around the cursor 
3. Make sure the cursor color adapts to the current seasonal theme
4. Ensure the changes work across all pages (index.html, settings.html, calendar.html)

Please implement these changes and show me the results immediately using the development server so I can see how it looks.
