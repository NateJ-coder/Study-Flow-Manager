## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Performance-Optimized Structure**
```
performance-build/           # Main application
├── index.html              # Landing page (React-inspired)
├── timer.html             # Minimal focus page  
├── calendar.html          # Session tracking
└── assets/
    ├── css/              # 24KB total - inline critical CSS
    ├── js/               # 42KB total - vanilla JavaScript  
    ├── images/           # 130MB total - lazy loaded
    └── audio/            # 4.5KB total - interaction sounds
```

### **Performance Strategy**
- **Critical**: Only `autumn-day-8.png` loads immediately (LCP optimization)
- **Lazy**: Remaining 46 images load every 3 seconds
- **Memory**: Max 2 concurrent images (current + next)
- **Zero Dependencies**: No CDN, web fonts, or external resources
